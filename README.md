# carbonplan / carbon-removal-application

**generic application for soliciting carbon removal procurement**

This repository contains a generic, unbranded application for soliciting carbon removal procurement. It is available in markdown format and released under a Creative Commons CC0 license, to maximize the potential for reuse and iteration. The raw content is available in the [`markdown`](/markdown) folder, and this repository is itself a [simple web app](https://carbon-removal-application.carbonplan.org) that renders the content.

The markdown files can be viewed directly here on GitHub, or in the demo website.

This application was developed as a collaboration between Stripe and CarbonPlan for Stripeâ€™s [Spring  2021 carbon removal purchase](). We received valuable input and feedback from many organizations and people in the process of developing it.
