# CO₂ Utilization Supplement

_Only fill out this supplement if it applies to you._

## 1) Feedstock

a) How do you source your CO₂, and from whom?

<textarea rows='5' cols='50' placeholder='<100 words' />

b) What are alternate uses for this CO₂ stream?

<textarea rows='5' cols='50' placeholder='<100 words' />

c) Do you have a pathway towards sourcing atmospheric CO₂ so as to achieve carbon removal? _(E.g. Future coupling of process to direct air capture)_

<textarea rows='5' cols='50' placeholder='<100 words' />

## 2) Utilization Methods

a) How does your solution use and store CO₂? What is the gross CO₂ utilization rate? _(E.g. CO₂ is mineralized in Material at a rate of X tCO₂ (gross) / t storage material)_

<textarea rows='5' cols='50' placeholder='<100 words' />

b) What happens to the storage material (e.g. concrete), and how does that impact its embodied carbon storage over time? How do you know?

<textarea rows='5' cols='50' placeholder='<100 words' />

c) How do you ensure that the carbon benefits you are claiming through a CO₂ utilization process are not double counted? (E.g. If sourcing CO₂ from a DAC system, or selling your product to a user interested in reducing their carbon footprint, who claims the carbon removal benefits and how could an independent auditor validate no double counting?)
