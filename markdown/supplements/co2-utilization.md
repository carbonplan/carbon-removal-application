Feedstock 
How do you source your CO₂, and from whom?
<100 words

What are alternate uses for this CO₂ stream?
<100 words

Do you have a pathway towards sourcing atmospheric CO₂ so as to achieve carbon removal? (e.g. Future coupling of process to direct air capture) 
<100 words
Utilization Methods 
How does your solution use and store CO₂? What is the gross CO₂ utilization rate? (E.g. CO₂ is mineralized in Material at a rate of X tCO₂ (gross) / t storage material). 
<100 words

What happens to the storage material (e.g. concrete), and how does that impact its embodied carbon storage over time? How do you know?
<100 words

How do you ensure that the carbon benefits you are claiming through a CO₂ utilization process are not double counted? (E.g. If sourcing CO₂ from a DAC system, or selling your product to a user interested in reducing their carbon footprint, who claims the carbon removal benefits and how could an independent auditor validate no double counting?)
