Feedstock and Physical Footprint
What type of biomass does your project rely on? 
<100 words

Are you growing that biomass yourself, or procuring it, and from whom? 
<200 words

Please fill out the table below regarding your feedstock’s physical footprint. If you don’t know (e.g. you procure your biomass from a seller who doesn’t communicate their land use), indicate that in the table.   


Area of land or sea (km2) in 2021
Competing/existing project area use (if applicable)
Feedstock cultivation
E.g. 1 km2 (floating kelp array) OR N/A (procuring waste biomass)  


Processing 
E.g. 0.1 km2 (boat yard, manufacturing facility) OR 0.5 km2 (manufacturing facility for mobile biochar plants)  


Long-term Storage 
E.g. N/A (uncertainty in final state of kelp) OR 2 km2 (ag fields in which biochar is deployed)



Imagine, hypothetically, that you’ve scaled up and are sequestering 100Mt of CO₂/yr. Please project your footprint at that scale (we recognize this has significant uncertainty, feel free to provide ranges and a brief description).  


Projected # of km2 enabling 100Mt/yr
Projected competing project area use (if applicable)
Feedstock cultivation




Processing 




Long-term Storage 





Permanence, Additionality, Ecosystem Impacts
How is your biomass processed to ensure its permanence?  What inputs does this process require (e.g. energy, water) and how do you source these inputs? (You should have already included their associated carbon intensities in your LCA in Section 6.) 
<200 words

If you didn’t exist, what’s the alternative use(s) of your feedstock? What factors would determine this outcome? (E.g. Alternative uses for biomass include X & Y. We are currently the only party willing to pay for this biomass resource. It’s not clear how X & Y would compete for the biomass resources we use. OR Biomass resource would not have been produced but for our project.) 
<50 words

We recognize that both biomass production and biomass storage can have complex interactions with ecological, social, and economic systems. What are the specific negative impacts (or important unknowns) you have identified, and what are your specific plans for mitigating those impacts (or resolving the unknowns)? (200 words)

Biomass-based solutions are currently being deployed around the world. Please discuss the merits and advantages of your solution in comparison to other approaches in this space.
