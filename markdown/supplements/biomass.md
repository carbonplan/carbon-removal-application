## Biomass Supplement

_Only fill out this supplement if it applies to you._

### 1) Feedstock and Physical Footprint

a) What type of biomass does your project rely on?

<textarea rows='5' cols='50' placeholder='<100 words' />

b) Are you growing that biomass yourself, or procuring it, and from whom?

<textarea rows='5' cols='50' placeholder='<200 words' />

c) Please fill out the table below regarding your feedstock’s physical footprint. If you don’t know (e.g. you procure your biomass from a seller who doesn’t communicate their land use), indicate that in the table.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Area of land or sea (km²) in 2021</th>
    <th>Competing/existing project area use (if applicable)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Feedstock cultivation</td>
    <td>
      <textarea
        rows='5'
        cols='40'
        placeholder='E.g. 1 km² (floating kelp array) OR N/A (procuring waste biomass)  '
      />
    </td>
    <td>
      <textarea rows='5' cols='40' />
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Processing</td>
    <td>
      <textarea
        rows='5'
        cols='40'
        placeholder='E.g. 0.1 km2 (boat yard, manufacturing facility) OR 0.5 km2 (manufacturing facility for mobile biochar plants)  '
      />
    </td>
    <td>
      <textarea rows='5' cols='40' />
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Long-term Storage</td>
    <td>
      <textarea
        rows='5'
        cols='40'
        placeholder='E.g. N/A (uncertainty in final state of kelp) OR 2 km2 (ag fields in which biochar is deployed)'
      />
    </td>
    <td>
      <textarea rows='5' cols='40' />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

d) Imagine, hypothetically, that you’ve scaled up and are sequestering 100Mt of CO₂/yr. Please project your footprint at that scale (we recognize this has significant uncertainty, feel free to provide ranges and a brief description).

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Projected # of km² enabling 100Mt/yr</th>
    <th>Projected competing project area use (if applicable)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Feedstock cultivation</td>
    <td>
      <textarea rows='5' cols='40' />
    </td>
    <td>
      <textarea rows='5' cols='40' />
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Processing</td>
    <td>
      <textarea rows='5' cols='40' />
    </td>
    <td>
      <textarea rows='5' cols='40' />
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Long-term Storage</td>
    <td>
      <textarea rows='5' cols='40' />
    </td>
    <td>
      <textarea rows='5' cols='40' />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### 2) Permanence, Additionality, Ecosystem Impacts

a) How is your biomass processed to ensure its permanence? What inputs does this process require (e.g. energy, water) and how do you source these inputs? (You should have already included their associated carbon intensities in your LCA in Section 6.)

<textarea rows='5' cols='50' placeholder='<200 words' />

b) If you didn’t exist, what’s the alternative use(s) of your feedstock? What factors would determine this outcome? (E.g. Alternative uses for biomass include X & Y. We are currently the only party willing to pay for this biomass resource. It’s not clear how X & Y would compete for the biomass resources we use. OR Biomass resource would not have been produced but for our project.)

<textarea rows='5' cols='50' placeholder='<50 words' />

c) We recognize that both biomass production and biomass storage can have complex interactions with ecological, social, and economic systems. What are the specific negative impacts (or important unknowns) you have identified, and what are your specific plans for mitigating those impacts (or resolving the unknowns)? (200 words)

<textarea rows='5' cols='50' placeholder='<200 words' />

d) Biomass-based solutions are currently being deployed around the world. Please discuss the merits and advantages of your solution in comparison to other approaches in this space.
