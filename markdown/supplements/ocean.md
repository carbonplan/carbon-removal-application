_Only fill out this supplement if it applies to you_

Physical Footprint
Describe the geography of your deployment, its relationship to coastlines, shipping channels, other human or animal activity, etc.
<200 words

Please describe your physical footprint in detail. Consider surface area, depth, expected interaction with ocean currents and upwelling/downwelling processes, etc. 
If you’ve also filled out the Biomass supplement and fully articulated these details there, simply write N/A.
<200 words

Imagine, hypothetically, that you’ve scaled up and are sequestering 100Mt of CO₂/yr. Please project your footprint at that scale, considering the same attributes you did above (we recognize this has significant uncertainty, feel free to provide ranges and a brief description).  
If you’ve also filled out the Biomass supplement and fully articulated these details there, simply write N/A.

Potential to Scale
Building large systems on or in the ocean is hard. What are your core engineering challenges and constraints? Is there any historical precedent for the work you propose? 
<200 words
Externalities and Ecosystem Impacts
How will you quantify and monitor the impact of your solution on ocean ecosystems, specifically with respect to eutrophication and alkalinity/pH, and, if applicable, ocean turbidity?
