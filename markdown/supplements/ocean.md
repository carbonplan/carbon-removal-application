## Ocean Supplement

_Only fill out this supplement if it applies to you._

### 1) Physical Footprint

a) Describe the geography of your deployment, its relationship to coastlines, shipping channels, other human or animal activity, etc.

<textarea rows='5' cols='50' placeholder='<200 words' />

b) Please describe your physical footprint in detail. Consider surface area, depth, expected interaction with ocean currents and upwelling/downwelling processes, etc. If you’ve also filled out the Biomass supplement and fully articulated these details there, simply write N/A.

<textarea rows='5' cols='50' placeholder='<200 words' />

c) Imagine, hypothetically, that you’ve scaled up and are sequestering 100Mt of CO₂/yr. Please project your footprint at that scale, considering the same attributes you did above (we recognize this has significant uncertainty, feel free to provide ranges and a brief description). If you’ve also filled out the Biomass supplement and fully articulated these details there, simply write N/A.

<textarea rows='5' cols='50' placeholder='<200 words' />

### 2) Potential to Scale

a) Building large systems on or in the ocean is hard. What are your core engineering challenges and constraints? Is there any historical precedent for the work you propose?

<textarea rows='5' cols='50' placeholder='<200 words' />

### 3) Externalities and Ecosystem Impacts

a) How will you quantify and monitor the impact of your solution on ocean ecosystems, specifically with respect to eutrophication and alkalinity/pH, and, if applicable, ocean turbidity?
