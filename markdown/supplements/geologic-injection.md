## 2) Throughput and Monitoring

c) Describe the geologic setting to be used for your project. What is the trapping mechanism, and what infrastructure is required to facilitate carbon storage? How will you monitor that your permanence matches what you described in Section 2 of the General Application?

e) At what rate will you be injecting your feedstock?

<textarea rows='5' cols='50' placeholder='Unit volume / unit time' />

## 3) Environmental Hazards

a) What are the primary environmental threats associated with this injection project, what specific actions or innovations will you implement to mitigate those threats, and how will they be monitored moving forward?
